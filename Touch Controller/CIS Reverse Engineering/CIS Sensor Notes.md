# Pin Layout:

1. GND
2. Clock (Seems to work at any frequency)
3. Pulse Signal (Seems to work best about every 1400 CLK cycles for 5 cycles)
4. GND
5. Analog Out (Right Half)
6. 3.3VW
7. Analog Out (Left Half)
8. GND
9. Red LED
10. Green LED
11. Blue LED
12. 3.3V LED

A higher analog output mean less light.
